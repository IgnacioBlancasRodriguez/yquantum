General directions on the challenge statement can be found in the _YQuantum_2025_challenge.pdf_ file. Follow below for extra relevant information.

## Installing Bloqade and other packages 

All work for this challenge will be based on Bloqade, QuEra's neutral atom emulator and SDK, and, if you feel insispired for something a bit more advanced, on Kiring, our compiler development infrastructure.

Installation instructions for Bloqade and all sub-packages necessary can be found here [here](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/), and amount to little more than `pip install bloqade`.

## Documentation

This yearâ€™s YQuantum challenges require a _notebook_ tutorial that is heavily considered during judging, as well as generating a small slide presentation to show the judges. The tutorial is the actual deliverable of the hackathon, while the presentation is your chance to describe your creation process and showcase the favorite outcomes of your work that would be hard to appreciate just by reading the notebook. 

### Submissions and pre-submissions

Submissions should follow the guidelines from Devpost. But make sure to remember that, for this challenge, we have an extra *8am Sunday* deadline for a pre-write-up of your work! This pre-write-up should take the shape of a notebook and contain the general learning goals you are aiming to explain, a skeleton of sections and topics, and any code you succeed developing until the given timeline.

Pre-write-ups won't be submitted via Devpost, but rather here on this repo. For that, here is the guideline:
1. Fork this repo, place all the code you wrote in one folder with your team name under the `team_solutions/` folder (for example `team_solutions/quantum_team`).
2. Create a new entry in `team_solutions.md` following the format shown that links to the folder with your solution and your documentation.
3. Create a Pull Request from your repository to this original challenge repository
4. Submit the "challenge submission" form
